# 6DOF
6 DOF Robotic Arm System

This project started as my junior college project that I have continued to build on after completing that class. The idea was for a dual arm system that communicated over a CAN Bus network. Each arm is controlled by an Arduino Mega2560 and receives commands from a Arduino Due controller.

This portion of the code runs on the Mega2560 and controls either of the two arms. It is currently being rewritten to improvement movement and convert to non-blocking code.

IDE: I am using visual studios with vMicro plugin
